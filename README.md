# reactionplanefit
This is code for implementing the reaction plane fit method.  It was originally written in ROOT 5, where it behaved fairly well.  I adapted it to ROOT 6 and now it gives somewhat unpredictable output and the fits do not always work well.  I have not entirely figured out why.  It appears to primarily have issues with the plotting macros and I believe this is because of, ahem, sloppy memory management in those classes.  It is likely to be fixed by more careful deletion of objects or making tese objects global in scope.
